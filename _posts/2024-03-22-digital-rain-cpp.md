## Introduction

So, what is Digital rain? If you've watched The Matrix then you know what I'm talking about. It's the icon green rain of Japanese characters falling down the screen, and if you're a big fan of the movie there is a chance you got some good cooking recipes out of it!
I recreated this icon simulation using C++.
In this blog I will describe my thought process behind creating my digital rain, the technologies used the details of code implementation along with any issues I faced along the way. 

I started with the basics... By playing The Matrix digital rain on YouTube at 0.25 speed. I must have spent a solid 10 minutes studying it, watching each droplet fall, and figuring out how it works. What I noticed is that a character is printed on the screen and then another new one just in front of it and so on. The droplets had a set size with the tail end slowly fading away. The droplets were also falling at different speeds. I focused on these characteristics of the droplet.
